    <h3>Music/Writing</h3>
    
    <p>I was told I had been singing since the early age of two. It was a peaceful way to express my emotions without speaking, even though you are singing words. As I got older in life, singing never slowed down for me. I began writing my own music at age 13. I improved my writing as I got older and my ability to incorporate it into my own personal songs. By 17 years old I attended a charter school for vocals. In this school I was ecouraged to learn piano. Once I learned piano, the sky was the limit. I could not get away from music and writing. Finally, I began to play my own songs on the piano while singing to my hearts content. It was safety for me. It was my heaven.</p>
  
    <p>Today, music is still a huge part of my everyday life. After releasing my first single in 2018, "Kill Me One Last Time", I stopped playing piano. However, I never stopped writing.</p>

    <p>My passion for both music and writing allowed me to follow any path I chose without free. Throughout my years I have had many different hobbies and interests. Truly, my passions have never failed to bring me that serenity I desperatly crave. </p>
   
   <h3>Games/Computers</h3>
   
    <p>Games have been a part of my life since childhood. I grew up along side the development of consoles, internet/computer, and cell phones. Truly incredible how far technology has come. Throughout the advancements, I fascinated on how this digital world worked. Within the last decade, I grew more and more interested in gaming and computers. I did my best to become a "good" gamer, and tried to take in all the information I could learn about computers.  </p>
   
    <p>Before the pandemic, I wanted to switch career paths. I previously desired to help individuals with substance abuse problems. Sadly the company I worked for did not see eye to eye when it came to staff and ethics. I continued on different jobs that were, simply put, meant for money. </p>
 
  
    <p>I am now desiring to further a career in computers, more specifically coding. </p>
   
   <h3>Career History</h3>
   
    <p>After doing some jobs, such as cashier, retail, restuarants, I became interested in helping individuals with substance abuse. I was known as a recovery coach and would interact frequently with our "patients" listening to their struggles. It was rewarding to know after they attended the program i worked for, they would remain sober while bettering their lives. Helping others has always been a common practice for myself. </p>
